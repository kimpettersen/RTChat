A simple app that lets you talk to a group of people without being logged in or registered
to any social network.

It aims to be an easy way to have a "short" conversation with a group of people without 
registering or installing anything on your computer or device.

Simply press "Start chat" and you will be in your own private chat room. Share your given URL
with the people you want to talk to and you can have a private conversation with them.

As you type, everyone can see what everyone is typing, so it will be as close you can get 
to a real conversation. (Without using video or voice conversation)

This project started Dec 18 2011 and was inspired by twitter-wave.no.de wich I worked on during
#hackmtl Dec 2011.
